Monte Carlo Simulation:
This repository deals with application of path finding of Stock prices using brownian motion and monte carlo simulation.
Overview
Brownian Motion: Also known as Wiener process, this is a continuous-time stochastic process that models random movement. It is a fundamental concept in the modeling of stock prices.
Monte Carlo Simulation: This technique uses random sampling to obtain numerical results, often used to understand the impact of risk and uncertainty in prediction and forecasting models.
Technical Indicators.ipynb
